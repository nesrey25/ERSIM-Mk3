     This function does the following things in order:
     1. Updates and checks to see if any Medics are finished treating their patients
     a) if they are, the appropriate records are updated
     2. Assigns any >10 priority patients (if there are any) to the available doctors (if there are any)
     3. Assigns and <10 priority patients (if there are any) to the available medics (if there are any)
     
     This has a side effect of having doctors be able to finish with a patient and begin treating another patient all in the same minute.
     Also note that the function cycles through the medics in the order they were added, and so by adding nurses first when the object is created,
     it avoids a situation where a doctor unecessarily treats a patient if an available nurse could have instead, at a potentially faster rate.
